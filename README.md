  <i>
    This is the home of the pipeline, chrom-seek. Its long-term goals: to accurately call and annotate peaks, to infer cell types in cell-free samples, and to boldly quantify diferential binding or accessibility like no pipeline before!

## Overview
Welcome to chrom-seek! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [chrom-seek's documentation](https://openomics.github.io/chrom-seek/).

The **`./chrom-seek`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>chrom-seek <b>run</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/chrom-seek/usage/run/): Run the chrom-seek pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>chrom-seek <b>unlock</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/chrom-seek/usage/unlock/): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>chrom-seek <b>install</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/chrom-seek/usage/install/): Download reference files locally.
 * [<code>chrom-seek <b>cache</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/chrom-seek/usage/cache/): Cache remote resources locally, coming soon!

**chrom-seek** is an an awesome set of pipelines designed specfically for cell-free ChIP-seq, bulk ChIP-seq, and bulk ATAC-seq sequencing data. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](https://openomics.github.io/chrom-seek/usage/run/) section of each available sub command.

For more information about issues or trouble-shooting a problem, please checkout our [FAQ](https://openomics.github.io/chrom-seek/faq/questions/) prior to [opening an issue on Github](https://github.com/OpenOmics/chrom-seek/issues).

## Dependencies
**Requires:** `singularity>=3.5`  `snakemake>=6.0`

At the current moment, the pipeline uses a mixture of enviroment modules and docker images; however, this will be changing soon! In the very near future, the pipeline will only use docker images. With that being said, [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases) must be installed on the target system. Snakemake orchestrates the execution of each step in the pipeline. To guarantee the highest level of reproducibility, each step of the pipeline will rely on versioned images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/nciccbr/repositories). Snakemake uses singularity to pull these images onto the local filesystem prior to job execution, and as so, snakemake and singularity will be the only two dependencies in the future.

## Installation
Please clone this repository to your local filesystem using the following command:
```bash

	abstract = {Existing monitoring approaches in heart transplantation lack the sensitivity to provide deep molecular assessments to guide management, or require endomyocardial biopsy, an invasive and blind procedure that lacks the precision to reliably obtain biopsy samples from diseased sites. This study examined plasma cell-free DNA chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (cfChIP-seq) as a noninvasive proxy to define molecular gene sets and sources of tissue injury in heart transplant patients. In healthy controls and in heart transplant patients, cfChIP-seq reliably detected housekeeping genes. cfChIP-seq identified differential gene signals of relevant immune and nonimmune molecular pathways that were predominantly down-regulated in immunosuppressed heart transplant patients compared with healthy controls. cfChIP-seq also identified cell-free DNA tissue sources. Compared with healthy controls, heart transplant patients demonstrated greater cell-free DNA from tissue types associated with heart transplant complications, including the heart, hematopoietic cells, lungs, liver, and vascular endothelium. cfChIP-seq may therefore be a reliable approach to profile dynamic assessments of molecular pathways and sources of tissue injury in heart transplant patients.},
